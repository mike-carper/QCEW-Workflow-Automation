Query and Analysis Automation Functions

Included in this repository are two Python scripts containing functions I wrote while working at the NYC Department of City Planning. The macro ("output") functions call the micro ("operation") functions to query, analyze, aggregate and peform privacy screening on NYS Department of Labor's Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages microdata. These data are shared with DCP under a NDA, so query samples cannot be included here. The scripts are included here as a template for microdata aggregation, privacy screening and query automation for both DCP staff and the public.
